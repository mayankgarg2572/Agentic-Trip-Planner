Plan a trip from Jaipur to Srinagar, visiting Dal Lake and Mughal Gardens, and suggest a good hotel near Lal Chowk. Prefer for Trains for communating as I like to enjoy journey also, prefer seats in reserved 3rd AC class.

Can you generate a 3 days trip plan from jaipur to Goa for visiting famous tourist spots in Goa? Prefer flight mode of transportation.

Please plan a trip from Jaipur to Jodhpur for visiting Mehrangarh Fort, Jaswant Thadha and Kaylana Lake, consider their opening and closing time with the best time to visit them. Also suggest a good hotel near Jodhpur Airport.

Plan a trip from Jaipur to three places, as Nathdwara ji Temple, Sawariya Seth temple(at Chittorgarh), and Ekling Ji Temple. I believe all three (Nathdwara ji Temple, Sawariya Seth temple and Ekling Ji Temple) are not more than 100 km from Each other. We will leave by coming Saturday evening with stay at Saturday Night or Sunday early morning like 5:00 am which you think suitable best. We want to come back to Jaipur by the same Sunday night any how in both cases. Consider opening and closing time of these temples as well. Generate a budget table considering food, accomodation as applicable.
