Hey, I want to build an interesting application that will help the user plan their trip using AI. Here in my application I want the user to show both an map, gui and in side bar an agent. In Map gui there will be a search bar. there the user can search and get a location shown in the Map . Similar to the way the Google map behave. Now I want that when user select a location on the Map GUI It should be made available to the agent which is in the sidebar. So I want to know is there a possibility of making such Map GUI which will have the search functionality and the normal way of behaving as the google map like dragging option and then marking a place or position on the map and then that position on the map I can get its latitude longitude or the better the place address itself which then can be feeded into LLM and then the user later can write a prompt for his/her trip over those address and then get the best trip suggestion. So you need to check if that Map GUI interactivity is possible? What kind of API keys we will need, are such exist in market place already, are they free for basic testing etc.?

Whenever someone search for a address then they should also see similar location on my map GUI than there they will select some location which I will store so that I can feed it in my LLM..

Okay so let's first fix the functional requirement of frontend. There will be two section of my home page. left and right. In left I will show the map gui and on the right I will have the LLM agent like a chatbot. In my Map GUI I will have a simple search bar at the top and the remaining thing will be a complete Map GUI. I will let's show the location of user based on the IP address. Then In the search functionality when user will type for something, currently i won't show any typeahead search options. When the user click on search or press enter I will make a call the backend with the respective address input then in backend I will use the API key and get the response from some provider and return back the coordinate + address and store that location in the database and then In frontend I will show the respective location from the response of backend on my MAP GUI. Till now there is no marker on the screen. Then user will mark a location maybe somewhere near the current showing location. Now I will show the marker of that location on my map GUI. Now after the user have marked a location then I will again make a call in the backend to store it in the database. This a is a the operation I want to have in my frontend GUI + backend. Such operation user can do a lot of time. Currently there is no such functionality for removing a marker from Map GUI. For selecting a position for marking the I have two ways in mind that user do a left click over a location no drag. Or the user right click over the required marking location in that user get the option to mark this location. I believe second way is better, what do you think. This is what I want. Now suggest how you will decide the basic architecture for now for the application for this use case.

Okay let's start thinking for tech stacks for the application for now I want to make a basic and minimal things which just show me working so choose some easier local/cloud database and tech stacks. One more important thing to consider that at the last I need to show the route recommended by the LLM or the Google Map or some other service provider for the trip on my Map GUI and also to mark the location clicked by user so choose the specific tech stacks which can easily do so.


Let's start building things. Provide me easy simple basic and logical folder structure crafted for this application use case for frontend and backend and specific what each filed folder responsible for ? And how it satisfying my application requirement and helping in maintaining the user flow and not creating conflicts with earlier(here earlier means in this current response only for the files which described earlier to what you will be currently describing when writing explanation for a file.) described structure.

=> SOme error

Okay let's first dictate the complete data flow in the frontend and UI management will work how different User actions and flow will be maintained in the frontend files and setup, then we will describe the code for the files. So first let's focus on the user flow in different frontend files.

Here there is an issue in the step 2 that when the responses gets received on the api.js how I can route that to automatically restructure my map view to center the provided location. I am here thinking of a like redux liked global state which will store the center location so the center location may either get updated in the api.js or in the searchBox.jsx(better here, I think as it will have more separation of concerns and logic) on getting a successful response's data and then this component will update the center location for the MapView.jsx and that will automatically will get re-renders I think.     

Now this simple react context is fine let's go ahead and first define responsibilities of each file like for which UI and actions they will be responsible and then write code for each file. 

Let's now move to the backend. In the similar way as earlier let's first decide the data flow in the backend as we have done in frontend it will help us if there is any fault in our thinking. So first we will cite all the API's we need to have in the backend and explain each of their utility like how they help in completing user actions. Then for each API we will also explain the data flow the starting file(I think, index.js ) to till the end(likely the controllers). Then we will explain the initial setup for the database. Here in the database what type of models and class do you think we should have so that we can easily store it in structured manner in mongoDB and later can convert into any SQL based DB if required. For now I will store two things in the DB the location that the user will mark at the last of the action. And the location that the user have searched. I think we can both type of entry in the same table/structure for now, as just a single field type will be different there like type which will indicate whether it is an marking entry or a search entry to the db. I think that will work. So for now we will first think for the different API's and each file's actions and also the DB structure.

I can't use mapBox API because they require credit card details initially, before even using free tier. So choose someone whose initial free tier doesn't asks for credit card, and can also work for our use case by which we can search for respective location coordinates and the addresses which is requirement for our search API.

I am using Geoapify. So consider defining respective functionality as per that API only. And must check if our current required functionality is possibly or not in the API, if that is fine then go ahead and start building the code for backend, so first define responsibilities of each file like for which actions/APIs they will be responsible for and then write code for each file.

provide package.json script as well

Index.js here not allowing URL for frontend update it to use Cors and allow only my frontend URL 



User journey: for e.g a user came to the agent and it said that "I will be going to Bengaloore on monday from New Delhi and on the same day I will have lunch with clients in evening. Before the evening lunch I want to go to some nearby Tourist spot. I will have my evening lunch at 5:30 pm in Taj hotel and then I will  come back to Delhi after lunch, so design my day at Bengaloore. "  Here basically I want that Agent first asks some clarifying question like till when they will be able to reach the New Delhi Airport in the monday morning.  What is their budget? Do they want to first place their luggage in some hotel then want to go Tourist spot or if luggage is less they want to directly go to tourist places? and some similar basic question which can help in getting their requirements better? After having get all the question clarified. If user have missed some question can asks the same question again. Then can go for finding out the right flight then right tourist spots as per the requirements. I think that this agent will be very big and difficult to handle and start for me as begineer what do you think. As currently I will also need to have some API by which I can know the flights timing for to and fro from a city. Then I also need to have an count for the Budget. Like for the hotels and other similar things.  What do you think? Like I feel I cannot believe on the agent's data itself.    

I am very doubtful if the path suggested by them would be correct or not?I am thinking of also making a node in my Agent which will try to access more than one path from a location to another location, so I can be made sure that okay the path being choose is not some very shortcut and is a general path.



So let's go ahead and design the application. First I want you to think of the folder structure for the FastAPI agent and routes and it's user flow. Explain me why you have made the specific files and folder choices? How they will help in the mentioned do and how they are not conflicting with all the folders and structure we have generated  


now let's redefine our complete backend logic again, With special focus over the Agent design and its folder structure clearly define every files and folder requirement. Also define the API's data flow, like from file to file from the time when first time the request come, so that we can have clear understanding. Also We also need to parse the model response so that we can easily send a JSON response to the user. Also now my mind have changed I feel I should store the LLM accepted location, instead of what users have provided. As sometimes the user may not even select any location and directly start chatting and in chat or say user prompt the location is included. Also I want to limit the fallback to node 2 and node 3 from node 4 similarly to node 4 from node 5. In this design process we will redefine the files/folder structure and similarly the function+class, their arguments and structures design that is  going to be implemented in each file. We will define the data logic flow at the last. 


Okay let's start coding each function and class now.
